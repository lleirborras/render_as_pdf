How to use :
------------
 - Look at the examples provided to see how it works.

 - forms work only with ADOBE READER 8 and 9.0
 
 - It is very important to provide valid HTML 4.01 to the converter,
   but only what is in the <body>

 - for borders: it is advised that they are like "solid 1mm #000000"

 - for padding, they are applicable only on tags table, th, td, div, li

 - the list of recognized HTML tags is in the file "_balises_html.xls"

 - The possibility to protect your PDF is present, CF Example 7. It uses the script
   fpdf_protection of Klemen Vodopivec.

 - Some specific tags have been introduced:
     * <page></page>  (CF Exemple 7) :
       determines the orientation, margins left, right, top and bottom, the background image
       and the background color of a page, its size and position, the footer.
       It is also possible to keep the header and footer of the previous pages,
       through the attribut pageset="old" (see Example 3)
 
     * <page_header></page_header> (CF Example 3)
     
     * <page_footer></page_footer> (CF Example 3)
     
     * <nobreak></nobreak> :
         used to force the display of a section on the same page.
         If this section does not fit into the rest of the page, a page break is done before.
 
     * <barcode></barcode>  (CF Examples 0 et 9) :
         can insert barcodes in pdfs, CF Examples 0 and 9
         The possible types od codebar are: EAN13, UPC_A, CODE39.
         This uses the scripts of The-eh and Olivier

     * <bookmark></bookmark>  (CF Examples 7 et About) :
         can insert bookmark in pdfs, CF Example 7 and About.
         It is also possible to automatically create an index at the end of
         documentv  CF Example About.
         This uses the scripts of Olivier and Min's
